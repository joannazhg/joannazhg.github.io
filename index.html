Welcome to my website, where I hope to share a bit about my projects, ideas and just more about myself.
I am a third year student at the University of Waterloo in the Mechatronics Engineering program. 
I have just wrapped up my coop term at Tesla as a Mechanical Engineering Intern. Most of my background is in robotics,
manufacturing, and design; stemming from leading and mentoring team 1325 (a FIRST robotics team) in addition to lots of
different side projects. Recently I've been trying to learn more about software engineering, algorithms, and entrepreneurship.
